# Weather-Application

I created a user-friendly weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to access real-time weather updates for cities worldwide with ease. By using an API, the application retrieves the latest weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. Users can simply input the name of their desired city, and the application displays comprehensive weather information in a visually appealing interface.
